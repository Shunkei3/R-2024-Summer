    "section": "2. Basic Components of Rmarkdown",
    "text": "2. Basic Components of Rmarkdown\nAn R Markdown document is divided into three main parts:\n\nYAML header\ntext body\ncode chunks.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each of these components briefly.\n\n\nYAML Header\nThe Rmarkdown document starts with a YAML header. It is a set of key:value pairs bounded by triple dashes ---. It contains metadata about the document, such as the title, author, and output format. Here is an example of a YAML header:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"2022-10-10\"\noutput: pdf_document\n---\nIn the output option, you can specify the document’s output format. For example, output: pdf_document will render the document as a PDF file. Other options include output: html_document for an HTML file and word_document for a Word document1. You can further customize the output format by adding additional options. For example, pdf_document has options such as toc for a table of contents and number_sections to number the sections.\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ndate: \"2022-10-10\"\noutput:\n  pdf_document:\n    toc: true\n    number_sections: true\n---\n\n\n\nMarkdown Syntax\nRamrkdown and Quarto use Markdown syntax to format text. These are just some rules for formatting texts (e.g., how to make a header, how to make a font bold or italic, how to make a list, etc.). Check this document to see how to use Markdown syntax to syle your texts:  Markdown Basics..\n\n\n\nCode Chunks\nIn R Markdown document, you write R code in a block called a code chunk. It looks like this:\n```{r}\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\nThere are many options you can configure for code chunks. For more detailed information about chunk options, please refer to  this article. Chunk options are specified in the body of a code chunk after #| (you can also define chunk options inside the curly braces ```{r}, but Quarto utilizes #| for setting chunk options. To ensure consistency in syntax between Rmarkdown and Quarto documents, it is advisable to use #|).\nFor example, you can hide the code from the final document by setting echo: false:\n```{r, summary-pressure}\n#| echo: false\nsummary(pressure)\n```\nYou can name the code chunk inside the ```{r}. This is useful for several reasons. For example, if error happens in the code chunk when rendering the document, you can easily locate the code chunk that caused the error because R Markdown will display the label of the code chunk in the error message. Also, if you want to cross-reference a figure or table in the text, you can use the label of the code chunk2.\nHere is another example of a code chunk that generates a figure. In this case, the code chunk is labeled fig-pressure, and the figure caption is set to “A figure caption”. The width of the figure is set to 50% of the width of the image container.\n```{r, fig-pressure}\n#| fig.cap: \"A figure caption\"\n#| out.width: 50%\n\nplot(pressure)\n```\nAlthough the base rmarkdown package does not provide direct support for cross-referencing, if you are using the bookdown package and setting output: bookdown::pdf_document2 or/and output: bookdown::html_document2 in the YAML header, you can use the make cross-reference figures and tables using the syntax @ref(type:label). For example, if you want to refer to a figure with the label fig-pressure, you can refer the figure with @ref(fig:fig-pressure). Try it on your Rmarkdown document!. For more detailed information about cross-referencing, please refer to  this document.\n\nGlobal Options\nInstead of manually setting the same chunk options in every code chunk (e.g., figure size), you can configure the default options for all code chunks in the document using the knitr::opts_chunk$set() function ( opts_chunk$set() function of the knitr package). For example, you can set the default figure size and alignment like this:\n```{r, setup}\n#| include: false\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  fig.width = 6, \n  fig.height = 4,\n  fig.align = \"center\"\n)\n```\ninclude: false means that the code and results associated with this chunk will not be appeared in the output document. Usually this setup chunk is placed at the beginning of the document, right after the YAML header.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis knitr::opts_chunk$set() is unique to Rmarkdown. In Quarto, you can set the default options for all code chunks in the document under execute field in the YAML header. We will see this in the Quarto section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Rmarkdown file for PDF format\n\n\n This is an example of an Rmarkdown file used to create a PDF document. The produced PDF file looks like  this. In this document, I also demonstrated how to use cross-referencing in the text. You can copy this file and modify it to suit your needs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips: How to display output of code in the cosole pane, not in the R markdown document?\n\n\nBy default, RStudio enables inline output (Notebook mode) on all R Markdown documents. This means that if you run a code chunk in R markdown on R studio, all the output, including the figure, is displayed below the end of the code chunk you just run (See the picture below). While this feature lets you interact with any R Markdown like a notebook, sometimes it is inconvenient, especially if you have a large code chunk. You can turn off this feature and display the code output in the console pane like in the usual R script (I had been bothered for long time until I found this solution.) Go to the gear button in the editor toolbar, and choose “Chunk Output in Console.” You will see that the chunk_output_type option is added to the YAML header of your R Markdown document.\neditor_options:\n  chunk_output_type: console\n\n\nNotebook mode (Default)How to disable Notebook mode?\n\n\n\n\n\nRmarkdown: inline output (Notebook mode)\n\n\n\n\nChoose “Chunk Output in Console”.\n\n\n\nHow to disable inline output (Notebook mode)\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Section 3.2 Notebook in “R Markdown: The Definitive Guide” by Yihui Xie, J.

For example, we extensively use R to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to understand the properties of different estimators and inference methods. In this course, we will go through the basics of R programming. Although the topics we can cover within five days are limited, I selected essential topics that would be directly helpful to establish a solid foundation for students’ R skills. These skills will not only be beneficial for first-year Ph.D. Econometrics classes but also for your personal research, empowering you to conduct independent studies and contribute to the field.",

Recent versions of RStudio come with Quarto already bundled, so you don’t need to install the Quarto CLI separately.\nReference: “Is it necessary to install Quarto separately from Rstudio?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Quarto in Rstudio?\n\n\nIf you are new to Quarto, I strongly recommend to read this official document to get started.\n\n\nFrom top-down of New file icon, crick “Quarto Document…” -&gt; Select “HTML” (or “PDF”) format -&gt; A new Quarto (.qmd) file pops up -&gt; Crick “Render” bottom to run the qmd file. The output document will be shown in the Viewer pane.\nIf “Render on Save” bottom is checked, the document will be rendered automatically when you save the file. This is particularly useful when you want to see real-time updates of your document without manually clicking the “Render” button each time you make a change.\n\n1.New .Rmd file2.Select HTML format3.Crick Render4.Output\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: You can choose HTML if you want a HTML document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic usage of Quarto is the same as R Markdown.\n Quarto document Cheet Sheet",

For MAC users, instead of the BLAS library that comes with R, you can use Apple’s vecLib (libBLAS.dylib), which is optimized for Apple to perform computations on large vectors. I don’t know if this works on your machine (especially for Windows). But you can try it to speed up R! The process is not complicated. Just follow the instructions in the link below.\n Accelerating R by Dr. Christopher D. Higgins\nEven faster matrix math in R on macOS with M1 by Mikhail Popov",
