    "text": "Instructor\n\n Shunkei Kakimoto\n 316a\n kakim002@gsu.edu\n\n\n\nCourse details\n\n August 19–August 23, 2024\n 1:00–4:00 pm\n 135B Ruttan\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description\nThis is a one-week course designed as an introduction to R statistical software for incoming graduate students. R is the leading software used in Ph.D.-level econometric classes in APEC (APEC 8211-8214). For example, we use R to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to understand the properties of statistical tools. In this course, we will go through the basics of R programming. Although the topics we can cover within five days are limited, I selected essential topics that would be directly helpful to establish a solid foundation for students’ R skills not only for first-year Ph.D. Econometrics classes, but also for personal research and future development of R skills.\n\nOfficial syllabus is available from here\n\n\n\n\nLeraning Objectives\nBy completing the course, students will be able to\n\ncreate an R project and know how to access and save data.\nhandle different types of base R objects (e.g. list, vector, matrix, and data.frame).\nuse basic data wrangling skills with the data.table package (e.g. subset rows, select and compute on columns, rename columns, perform aggregations by group, merge multiple datasets, and reshape wide-to-long and long-to-wide, respectively).\nwrite their own R functions.\nwrite code for simple Monte Carlo Simulations with loop.\nuse basic ggplot functions to visualize data\n\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the course\n\nDownload and Install R and R studio on your laptop. To do this, follow the procedure described in this website\nGet UCard access to Ruttan Hall:\n\nRequest advanced access to the building (Ruttan Hall) through this form.\nIf you have questions, reach out to Melissa Isle (webe0342@umn.edu)\n\nFinish the Survey.\nBring your laptop to the class.\n\n\n\n\nClass Style\nEach lecture will be divided into three sessions, where each session consists of a 50-minute lecture and a 10-minute break.\nBy just looking at code, you cannot acquire the skills for coding. The only way to learn coding is to do it yourself! At the end of each topic, we will work on small quizzes to check your understanding level. In addition, there will be exercise problems at the end of the slides. These exercise problems require you to combine multiple operations you learned in the lecture. Of course, I do not expect you to solve the quizzes and exercise problems immediately. I want you to go through the problems many times until you feel comfortable. The solutions are included in the slides.",
