R is the leading software used in Ph.D.-level econometric classes in APEC (APEC 8211-8214). For example, we use R to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to understand the properties of statistical tools. In this course, we will go through the basics of R programming. Although the topics we can cover within five days are limited, I selected essential topics that would be directly helpful to establish a solid foundation for students’ R skills not only for first-year Ph.D. Econometrics classes, but also for personal research and future development of R skills.",

The only way to learn coding is to do it yourself! At the end of each topic, we will work on small quizzes to check your understanding level. In addition, there will be exercise problems at the end of the slides. These exercise problems require you to combine multiple operations you learned in the lecture.
