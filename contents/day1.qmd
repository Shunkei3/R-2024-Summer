+ to learn about the basic features of **Rstudio**{style = "color:steelblue"}.
+ to understand different types of R-base data structures and how to create and manipulate them.
+ understand how to do Matrix/Linear Algebra in R.
+ to be able to install and load R packages.
+ to be able to load and save data in R.

### Preparation
If you are completely new to R and R studio, these sections from the book "R for Data Science" might be helpful to read before the class. Each section is very brief. Also, don't worry about the code in the book.:

+ [Section 1.4: Prerequisites](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites){target="_blank"}

+ [Section 2: Workflow: basics](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics.){target="_blank"}

+ [Section 6: Workflow scripts and projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts)
  + We'll use RStudio projects instead of set working directory manually. Section 6.2.3 RStudio projects is helpful if you are not familiar with RStudio projects.

Faster matrix operations in R 
::::
:::{.solutionbox-body}
+ By default, R ships with two libraries for common mathematical operations: Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package). For MAC users, instead of the BLAS library that comes with R, you can use Apple's vecLib (libBLAS.dylib), which is optimized for Apple to perform computations on large vectors. I don't know if this works on your machine (especially for Windows). But you can try it to speed up R! The process is not complicated. Just follow the instructions in the link below.
