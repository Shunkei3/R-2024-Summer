## Download the datasets

Follow the instruction below:

+ Create a new folder for this course (e.g., `R_summer_2024`). 
+ In this course, we mostly use the data from websites and the data attached to R packages but we will occasionally use additional data that I will provide. Please download the datasets from [this link {{< fa download >}}](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/onuxrv9z5p9onfb5jaf56/AEcFPsDrbLlPfPy9cXwEpyE?rlkey=z3ozk85mv02ujwytv9yu4sjno&st=so8hay8r&dl=0){target="_blank"}.
  + Once you open the link, click on the `Download` button at the top. [It will ask you to login or sign up. At the bottom of this window, please click "Or continue with download only" to download the file.]{style="color: blue;"}
+ After unzipping the file, it will automatically create a folder named `Data`. Move this folder to your `R_summer_2024` folder.
+ Additionally, inside of your `R_summer_2024` folder, you need to create a folder named `Code`.
+ Now you're ready to begin!

Your `R_summer_2024` folder should look like this:
