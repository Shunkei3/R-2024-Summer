title: "Day 5: Function, Loop, and Monte Carlo Simulation (Under Construction)"
---

Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool in Econometrics and Statistics fields. From the student perspective, it is a great way to understand the statistical properties of the various estimators and inference techniques. In this class, we will learn how to write R code to conduct Monte Carlo simulations.
