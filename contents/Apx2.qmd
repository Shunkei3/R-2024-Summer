Before render R Markdown documents to PDF on your Rstudio, make sure that your computer has a LaTeX distribution installed. You can download and install the TinyTeX distribution with the R package [`tinytex`](https://yihui.org/tinytex/). Unlike other LaTex distributions like MacTeX, `tinytex` is a lightweight distribution that only includes the essential packages needed to render R Markdown documents to PDF.

```r
tinytex::install_tinytex()
# to uninstall TinyTeX, run
# tinytex::uninstall_tinytex()
```

**Template Rmarkdown document for PDF format**

+ For exmaple, you can copy [this file](https://github.com/Shunkei3/R-slides/blob/main/z_doc/z_publised_dir/template_for_pdf.Rmd) to produce a PDF file like [this](https://shunkei3.github.io/R-slides/z_doc/z_publised_dir/template_for_pdf.pdf){target="_blank"}.


### Introduction to Markdown Syntax

Ramrkdown and Quarto use Markdown syntax to format text. They are just some rules to format text (e.g., how to make a header, how to make a font bold or italic, how to make a list, etc.). Check this document to see the basic markdown syntax: {{< fa file >}} [Markdown Basics](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).



### Code Chunks

In R Markdown, you write code in a block called a code chunk. It looks like this:
`````
```{r}

```
