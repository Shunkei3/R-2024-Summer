title: "Day 2: Data Wrangling with `data.table` package"
---


The R package `data.table` is an extension of the `data.frame` class and is equipped with lots of additional powerful functionalities designed to handle large datasets. It is built for speed and efficiency. Unlike functions of the `dplyr` package (another popular R package for data wrangling), in which you need to use a specific function for each task, the syntax of `data.table` is so simple and consistent that you can do almost everything with just a few commands. Let's see how it works in this lecture.

+ To be able to use the basic data wrangling skills with the `data.table` package:
  + subset rows
  + select and compute on columns
  + rename columns
  + perform aggregations by group
  + merge multiple datasets
  + reshape wide-to-long and long-to-wide, respectively
+ to be able to use `%>%` operator of the `magrittr` package.

The data.table package supports multithreading, allowing it to efficiently handle large datasets using multiple CPU cores simultaneously. To set up multithreading in data.table, you need to configure your system a bit (at least for Mac users). I followed {{< fa newspaper >}} [this instruction](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation#linux-and-mac), and it worked well for me. If you are interested in this, you can try it out!
